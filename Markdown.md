# 📘 What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that lets you write formatted documents using plain text. It was created by **John Gruber** in 2004 with the goal of being *as easy to read and write as plain text*, while still allowing rich formatting.

It's widely used in places like:
- GitHub (`README.md` files, issues, pull requests)
- Documentation sites
- Static site generators (e.g. Jekyll, Hugo)
- Messaging platforms like Discord and Slack

## 🎯 Why Was Markdown Created?

The goal of Markdown was to create a syntax that:
- Is **readable in raw form**
- Can be **easily converted to HTML**
- Is **accessible** to non-programmers and programmers alike

In short: *Make writing for the web simple and intuitive.*
